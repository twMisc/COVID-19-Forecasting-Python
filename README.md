# COVID-19-Forecasting-Python
Predict the covid-19 confirmed and deaths using collected datas and simple models.

# How to run
Here we demonstrate how to run our program in UNIX environment. Suppose one has python3, pip, git installed. First download the dataset and our program. 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/
$ git clone https://github.com/twMisc/COVID-19-Forecasting-Python
$ cd COVID-19-Forecasting-Python
```

Install the required packages in Python.
```bash
$ pip install xgboost numpy tensorflow scikit-learn tabulate matplotlib plotly pandas
```
Alternatively, install the requirements using `requirements.txt` if you encountered into some trouble.
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then modify the file `forecasting_setup.py` as required
```python
observe_days = 30
predict_days = 1
keepdays = 150
training_countries = ['US','Spain','Belgium','China','France','Germany','United Kingdom','Italy']
```
* observe_days: input data length
* predict_days: output data length 
* keepdays: the length of data to NOT use in training
* training_countries: the countries to be used in training, can be found in `country_list.txt`

Run `forecasting_run.py` in console to see the results if you want a quick glance.
```bash
$ python forecasting_run.py
```

## Run in Visual Studio Code interactive window
To use this, you must have a Python environment where you have installed the [Jupyter Package](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/). You should also install the  [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) in VScode. Check out VScode's [doc](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py) if you want to learn more.

Open `forecasting_run.py` in VScode, which also includes some explanation.

## Run in Jupyter Notebook
If you have [Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install.html) installed, you can use them as well.

Open `forecasting_run.ipynb` in JupyterLab or the classic Jupyter Notebook.

## Run it in Python interpreter
You can also use the function yourself in your python console. After setting up your `forecasting_setup.py`, in python run
```python
>>> from forecasting_multi import print_and_draw
>>> print_and_draw('Japan')
```
Replace Japan with any country in `country_list.txt`. Note that two html plot files `forecasting_confirmed.html` and `forecasting_deaths.html` generated by Plotly should also be available after running `print_and_draw(country_name)` where `country_name` is your input.
